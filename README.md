# Looking for structure in entrainment behavior

This is an updated version of the code for the following paper (with slightly different results):
Weise, A., & Levitan, R. (2018). Looking for structure in lexical and acoustic-prosodic entrainment behaviors. NAACL HLT 2018, 2, 297â€“302. http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2048

Five acoustic-prosodic and three lexical measures are computed and applied to the Switchboard Corpus and (some of them) the Columbia Games Corpus. Data for the corpora is not contained.
Analysis of the measures includes the search for: correlations between them, co-occurrences, k-means clusters, and redundant dimensions (through PCA).
